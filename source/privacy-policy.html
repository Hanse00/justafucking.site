        <title>Just a Fucking Site - Privacy Policy</title>

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Remember how I said there was no privacy policy? Turns out I'm full of shit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact of the matter is that the internet is a complicated place,
            and even for a simple fucking site like this one, I'm not in <strong>complete</strong> control of what happened when you browsed to this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between your device manufacturer, their software vendors and subcontractors, your internet provider, the other network providers your traffic flowed through from you to Cloudflare, the company that is hosting this page, not to mention the numerous government agencies from a dozen countries trying to violate Cloudflare's privacy, so that they can then violate yours and mine in turn, there are so many fucking places your privacy might have been violated that it would be a doozy to tally them all.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I can say is this: I didn't try to violate your fucking privacy.
            I didn't explicitly instruct Cloudflare to do so on my behalf either.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the rest? Good fucking luck. The world of software is fucked with privacy violations.
