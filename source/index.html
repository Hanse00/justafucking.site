            <h2>What is this site?</h2>
            <p>
                This site, is <em>just</em> a fucking site.
                There's no fucking business model,
                there's no fucking <a href="privacy-policy.html" hreflang="en">privacy policy</a>,
                and there sure as fuck is no cookie-consent-optout-dark-pattern banner for you to lose your shit trying to click through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Because a site doesn't <em>need</em> any of those fucking things. And this site is just that, a site. Nothing more.
            </p>
            <h2>What can I do with this site?</h2>

                <a href="https://github.com/Hanse00/justafucking.site/blob/main/LICENSE" hreflang="en">Whatever the fuck you want - ish.</a>
                But just know, if you use it as cannon-fodder for some asinine large language model scheme, you disappoint me.
