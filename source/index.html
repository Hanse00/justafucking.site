        <h1>What is this site?</h1>
        <p>
            This site, is <em>just</em> a fucking site.
            There's no fucking business model,
            there's no fucking privacy policy,
            and there sure as fuck is no cookie-consent-optout-dark-pattern banner for you to lose your shit trying to click through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why? Because a site doesn't <em>need</em> any of those fucking things. And this site is just that, a site. Nothing more.
